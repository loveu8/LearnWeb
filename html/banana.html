            The Man Who Knew Trees
        </h2>
        <p>Stanley Plumly knew trees. It was partly the accident of circumstance.<br>
            His grandfather, P. W. Plumly<sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup>, a “farmer
            of trees,” founded the P. W. Plumly Lumber Corporation in Winchester, Virginia, a small town in the
            Shenandoah
            Valley. The business employed most of the Plumly family and, during the Second World War, it made millions
            by
            catering to the US army’s nearly limitless appetite for lumber. </p>

            A banana is an elongated, edible fruit—botanically a berry[1]—produced by several kinds of large treelike
            herbaceous
            flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, cooking bananas are called plantains, distinguishing
            them
            from
            <b>dessert bananas</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia; they were probably domesticated in New Guinea.
            They
            are grown in 135 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make banana paper and
            textiles,
            while some are grown as ornamental plants. The world's l，argest producers of bananas in 2022 were India and
            China,
            which together accounted for approximately 26% of total production. Bananas are eaten raw or cooked in
            recipes
            varying from curries to banana chips, fritters, fruit preserves, or simply baked or steamed.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant.[2] All the above-ground parts of a banana
                plant
                grow
                from
                a structure called a corm.[3] Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy with a treelike appearance, but
                what
                appears to be a trunk is actually a pseudostem composed of multiple leaf-stalks (petioles). Bananas grow
                in
                a
                wide
                variety of soils, as long as it is at least 60 centimetres (2.0 ft) deep, has good drainage and is not
                compacted.[4]
                They are fast-growing plants, with a growth rate of up to 1.6 metres (5.2 ft) per day.[5]

            Musa 'Nendran' cultivar, grown widely in the Indian state of Kerala

            The genus Musa was created by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.[18] The name may be derived from Antonius Musa,
            physician
            to the
            Emperor Augustus, or Linnaeus may have adapted the Arabic word for banana, mauz.[19] The ultimate origin of
            musa
            may be
            in the Trans–New Guinea languages, which have words similar to "#muku"; from there the name was borrowed
            into
            the
            Austronesian languages and across Asia, accompanying the cultivation of the banana as it was brought to new
            areas, via
            the Dravidian languages of India, into Arabic as a Wanderwort.[20] The word "banana" is thought to be of
            West
            African
            origin, possibly from the Wolof word banaana, and passed into English via Spanish or Portuguese.[21]
