            A banana is an elongated, edible fruit—botanically a berry[1]—produced by several kinds of large treelike
            herbaceous
            flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, cooking bananas are called plantains, distinguishing
            them

        <p>
            Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia; they were probably domesticated in New Guinea.
            They
            are grown in 135 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make banana paper and
            textiles,
            while some are grown as ornamental plants. The world's l，argest producers of bananas in 2022 were India and
            China,
            which together accounted for approximately 26% of total production. Bananas are eaten raw or cooked in
            recipes
            varying from curries to banana chips, fritters, fruit preserves, or simply baked or steamed.

            <p>
                The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant.[2] All the above-ground parts of a banana
                plant
                grow
                from
                a structure called a corm.[3] Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy with a treelike appearance, but
                what
                appears to be a trunk is actually a pseudostem composed of multiple leaf-stalks (petioles). Bananas grow
                in
                a
                wide
                variety of soils, as long as it is at least 60 centimetres (2.0 ft) deep, has good drainage and is not
                compacted.[4]
                They are fast-growing plants, with a growth rate of up to 1.6 metres (5.2 ft) per day.[5]
